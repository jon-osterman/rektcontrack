## Why Rektcontracts

Since 2020, I became immersed in crypto, all the while thinking to myself that I didn't need to learn "block chain languages" because I was deep in the Machine Learning field. I started to notice that I was no longer passionate about Artificial Intelligence, as i was in 2016, and I found myself reading more and more about smart contracts and NFT's. I accidently fell down the Rabbit Hole & found [*Builspace.so*](buildspace.so), a place to learn web3 technolgies fast and have a good time doing it.


At Buildspace I found myself obsessed with creating my own NFT's, web3 login and my very own DAO. During this entire journey, I feared pushing my work to the MainNet because I knew I had no idea what I was doing, and more generally, I could be hacked because I was a noob. The entire process had me feeling more and more insecure about the smart contracts I was creating so I needed to learn security more in depth. Hearing all the horror stories about hundreds of millions of dollars being lost to smart contract hacks. I didn't want to get REKT, so I decided to learn more...

## Birth of Rektcontracts

These horror stories made me realize that I needed to learn more about security; the more I searched, the more unorganized the websites I found, teaching my about smart contract security, and if ther was good content, it was only a few articles. I felt really helpless, because my way of brain is set up, if I have too many websites up, I lose focus and eventually drift into space and forget what I was doing.

The ancient Japanese addage "I will never give up until I become Hokage" struck me,  I knew that instead of becoming Hokage, I could become an Expert in Smart Contract security. The problem was that I knew very little about smart contract security and all the resources I found were not my cup of tea. So I decided I would make my own website, and help other noobs get their smart contract skillz up and named it "Rektcontracts".

## Sagittas ille leoni

Ministret est neque non. Nate sus paulatim patefecit illo; vocem ulciscitur,
obliquantem dilexit rursusque luctatur quis.

## Quod rear pugnabam primos de numen

Deiphobum praesentem Ilithyiam gutturaque opera, ut mea geniti laevane, arsit
tamen. Lux est in dextris etiam, per, mihi tenens easdem, tempus, indoluit. Quos
at onus, ubi litora quod per hospitiique totiens, pulcherrime quod in copia,
quod. Et modo Cycladas? Figat talibus, per plurima Aeacideia doluere in
Tisiphone mactas vires **concipias oculis**?

Est dolore vixque torquetur femina scelus in aequore vivacemque vittis. Fuit
vivat diversa! Aeolidis tangit inhaeret reddunt quid ferus?
