## Birth of RÎžkt
Out of a desire to end the constant news of hundreds of millions of dollars in hacked smart contracts, I started Rektcontracts to learn how to make safe smart contracts for myself. The reality was that if I needed this, you irrespective of your skillset could learn at least one thing you didn't already know. All I ask is that you help those who come after you the same way this website helped us both.

## Our Mission

The future of the internet and the economy, will rely on smart contract technologies that are safe to use. Eventhough it is still early days, and smart contracts are in their infancy, in order for smart contracts to mature, developers will need to focus on security. Rektcontracts was created for developers to understand the basic elements of making smart contracts **GREAT!** In order for smart contracts to prosper and become what the internet was supposed to be, we must solve security first. Our aim at Rektcontracts is to foster a community of smart contract security experts who will help others learn from previous mistakes in order to create a more vibrant and inclusive ecosystem for web3 to thrive in the future.


## Learn from failure 
As web3 becomes apart of the world economy, the likelihood of contracts getting hacked increases with time. Our goal is to dissect every smart contract that has failed to keep investor assets safe & learn from them. By learning from Rektcontracts, developers will be able further improve their skillsets and avoid hacked contracts in the future
